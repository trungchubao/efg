# EFficient string Generator
------------
Given string constraints represented by Context-Free Grammar (CFG), EFG will produce the number of strings satisfy the constraints.

EFG is written in C++ and utilizing GMP library for big integers calculations.
The tool is developed to verify the algorithm proposed in "Counting algorithms for recognizable and algebraic series." written by Trung Chu Bao, Kenji Hashimoto and Hiroyuki Seki.
The paper is published in IEICE Transaction on Information and System, 2018 June.
